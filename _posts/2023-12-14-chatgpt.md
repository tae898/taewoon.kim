# Generating images with text

I've been using it massively for everything lately. It's also integrated into VS Code,
which really helps me to write code faster. Below is an example on how I generated the
cover image for this post.

Haha looking good Now I've found what I want.\

Hmm ... It's certainly biased. But it understood that I made a typo "while"
