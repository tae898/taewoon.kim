This paper was a result of the Hugging Face BigScience research workshop that I
participated in 2021. The paper can be found at
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100).

**_Abstract_**: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to perform new
tasks based on a few demonstrations or natural language instructions. While these
capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich
organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing
this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model
designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a
decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset
comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total).
We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks,
with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate
future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code
under the Responsible AI License.
