I thought that I can make a better website than the one I had. So I made this one! I'll
be posting my projects and other stuff here. I hope you like it! :) I was surprised that
I could make this website in just a few hours. I used [Jekyll and GitHub
Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to
make this website. I also used a theme called
[beautifuljekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/). Most of the images used are generated
by DALL-E from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) Everything was so easy. I feel like
I'm living in the future.
