I love diving into AI stuff! I’m both a researcher and engineer in the AI world.
I've studied and worked in several countries, including South Korea, Germany,
and the Netherlands. Being a researcher and engineer is like finding the sweet
spot between brainstorming new ideas and making them actually work in real life.
I believe figuring out and improving artificial general intelligence is super
important for all of us. I’m all about open-sourcing projects because it’s the
best way to make AI better together.
