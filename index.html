I imagine a future where machines and humans coexist. I'm generally interested in
technology and science that can help us get there. I'm currently working on HumemAI (A
Machine With Human-Like Memory Systems) that use both symbolic and sub-symbolic AI
techniques to build a machine that can learn and reason like humans.
