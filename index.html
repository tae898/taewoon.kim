I'm all about making AI work for people, blending the best of research and engineering.
From my PhD work, I started HumemAI, where we're doing something cool: making AI think
more like us using ideas from cognitive science. It's not just any AI; itâ€™s designed to
communicate better with humans. Right now, I'm on the lookout for smart folks and some
funding to help grow this idea. My goal? To make AI not just smart, but also easy for
everyone to use and benefit from.
